The Lion and the Mouse: 
    One day, a lion was sleeping in the forest when a little mouse accidentally ran over his nose. 
    The lion woke up and was about to eat the mouse, but the mouse pleaded for his life, promising to help the lion someday. 
    The lion, amused by the idea, let the mouse go. Later, the lion was caught in a hunter's net. 
    The mouse heard the lion's roars and rushed to help. He gnawed through the ropes of the net, freeing the lion.
    Moral: Kindness is never wasted. Even the smallest creature can help the mightiest.
